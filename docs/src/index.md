# MMF NEXUS

Documentation for [MMFNEXUS](https://github.com/BDAlferink/MMFNexus.jl).


This is the Julia implementation for the NEXUS+ algorithm. More information and standalone application can be found on our website in the future.

## Installation

The Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) NEXUS can be installed with the Julia package manager. From the Pkg Repl mode run (accessed by `]`):

```julia
pkg> add MMFNexus
```

Or, equivalently, via the `Pkg` API:

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("MMFNexus")
```

if it is not available in the registery yet, use the following instead.
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/BDAlferink/MMFNexus.jl")
```

## Usage

The basic usage of the NEXUS+ routine requires a density field with non-zero values everywhere. For optimal results, we suggest density field reconstructions using [DTFE](https://github.com/MariusCautun/DTFE), or [Phase-Space DTFE](https://github.com/jfeldbrugge/PhaseSpaceDTFE.jl). How to reconstruct a density field from a particle distribution is found on the respective pages. The density field should be normalized, i.e. $\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\text{mean}}} = 1 + \delta$.

Given the normalized density field (`densityField`), we identify the cosmic web environments as follows:

```julia
using MMFNEXUS

# field and box parameters (example from the reconstruction of the illustris-3 box sampled at 256^3)
N = 256 # number of gridpoints per dimension
L = 75. # Box size in cMpc/h
totalMass = 4e8 * 455^3 # total mass contained in simulation box in Msun/h 

MMF_node, MMF_filament, MMF_wall, MMF_void = NEXUS_Plus(densityField, N, L, totalMass);

```

The resulting `MMF_*` outputs are BitArray's of size (N,N,N) where for each voxel, one of the morphological environments has the value `1` and all others are `0` to indicate to which environment it belongs. There are a number of optional settings which are discussed in the tutorial section of the documentation.
